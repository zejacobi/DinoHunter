This data largely wasn't created by me. Only the files prefixed by `zj` are mine and only those
files are covered by the license for this project. The other sets of files are:

* `aq_` - Anscombe's quartet, a well known set of series used to illustrate the dangers of summary
  statistics. See [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anscombe%27s_quartet) for more 
  information.
* `d12_` - The "Datasaurus Dozen" created by Autodesk. See 
  [their blog](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anscombe%27s_quartet) for more information.
  
I would also like to express appreciation for 
[Draw My Data](http://robertgrantstats.co.uk/drawmydata.html), which is how I came up with my two
example sets.
